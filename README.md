- 👋 Hi, I’m Merve. I currently reside in Spain.
- 👀 I’m interested in learning coding, music, science and techology as well.
- 🌱 I’m still a newbie in web dev. Therefore, I'm continuously learning something new everyday. Nowadays I am learning React. In the meanwhile, I'm revising JS and the libraries/frameworks I've learnt so far and  experimenting/building content with them, such as HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and jQuery.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that I can use my fresh skills on HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
