- 👋 Hi, I’m @merv-e
- 👀 I’m interested in learning coding, music, science and a little bit of techology as well
- 🌱 I’m still a newbie in web dev. Therefore, still continously learning something new everyday. I'm currently revising the languages I've learnt so far and  experimenting/building content with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any project that I can use my skills on HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
